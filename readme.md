# apacheinfo.php

## Purpose: 
Inspired by phpinfo(),

A Very useful script to find the list of modules loaded / enabled on apache.

This would be quite handy for folks who are hosting the websites on shared hosting, when you don't get ssh access to find the loaded modules this becomes quite easy.
 
## Version: 1.0
 
### ChangeLog:

Ver 1.0
Current Implementations does the following

1. Get Apache Version info.
2. list of apache modules loaded.
 
### Todo:
